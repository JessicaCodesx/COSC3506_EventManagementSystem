# Things to do:
## ADMIN
1) Reports: Create generate report button. Generate a report for name of an event/events, how many people attended each event, the location of each event, and the overall client satisfaction on scale of 1-5 regarding client satisfaction) **MOSTLY DONE AWAITING CLIENT SATISFACTION DATA**
3) User Management (sidebar) + View All Users -- links to same page, not implemented
4) Add User **DONE**
5) Price on Event (per seat/per attendee/etc)
6) Invoice (selecting an event causes bug and screen to go completely blank)
7) Annual Billing 20% Off Tab Does Not Work (278, 754/948, 1899/2388)
8) Admin Information Confused with Vendor Information. Admin -> More global payment information like total events and total users add/managing users. No need for a vendor or client to also have an admin account
9)  Admin needs to be able to take care of staff and vendor assignment


## Client
1) View All for Events
2) View All for Invoices Due/Paid/Processing
3) Update Profile Page physical address, phone number, and other contact information
4) Event needs to be able to request vendors from client side 
5) Rate on a scale of 1 to 5 a vendor I went with
6) See progress of event (Event Created -> Service(s) Requested from Vendor(s) -> Services Confirmed -> Event Ready -> Event Completed

## Vendor:
1) Need to differentiate between current assigned events that are not completed and completed events. 
2) Need to be able to submit invoices for completed events. Need to be able to post total prices along with available services
3) Can accept/decline events where services are requested
4) Implement set availability page **DONE** - 
5) Post availability and unavailability to the back-end

## General: 
1) EMS removal to "default home page" and go to dashboard **DONE**
2) "Log out" should create a successful log out alert and go to home page not log-in page  **DONE**
3) Remove sign-in button when already signed in on "home page". Home should lead to dashboard not the "logged out information home page" - **DONE**
4) Remove dashboard header search bar - **DONE**

## Staff:
Delete profile and ability to create staff profiles. Admin will assign "freelancer" staff to events. Staff profiles are an unneessary scope for the project
